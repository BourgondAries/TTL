{\ttfamily \#include $<$Join\-Thread.\-hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class works exactly like std\-::thread since it inherits therefrom and delegates all constructor arguments to std\-::thread\-::thread(...)


\begin{DoxyCode}
*  \textcolor{keywordtype}{int} n = 0;
*  \hyperlink{class_join_thread}{JoinThread} thr
*  (
*      [](\textcolor{keywordtype}{int} &number)
*      \{
*          number++;
*          std::this\_thread::sleep\_for(std::chrono::seconds(3));
*      \},
*      std::ref(n)
*  );
*  
\end{DoxyCode}


Don't worry about detaching the thread, a check is performed during destruction to make sure the thread is joinable.
