{\ttfamily \#include $<$Synched.\-hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Using \hyperlink{class_synched}{Synched} will allow for multiple readers to read, whilst only a single writer can write at a time. The protective method is the same as the one employed by std\-::weak\-\_\-ptr. This method uses a temporary object.


\begin{DoxyCode}
*  \hyperlink{classttl_1_1_synched}{ttl::Synched<int>} xxx(32);
* 
*  \textcolor{comment}{// From thread 1:}
*  \textcolor{keyword}{auto} x = xxx.getReadAccess(); \textcolor{comment}{// Reader object, multiple can exist simultaneously.}
*  std::cout << *x << std::endl;
* 
*  \textcolor{comment}{// From thread 2:}
*  \textcolor{keyword}{auto} x = xxx.getWriteAccess(); \textcolor{comment}{// Writer object, no more than 1 can exist simultaneously.}
*  (*x)++;
