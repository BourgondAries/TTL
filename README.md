TTL - Tea Tank Library
======================

Purpose
----------

A C++ library of tools to make generic functionality easier to achieve.
Using this library, one will be able to quickly code constructs that are often used.
This will most likely save the programmer a lot of time and effort, and results in cleaner
looking code.
The library's only dependence is the C++ standard library.
Many parts of the library are stand-alone parts and can function without other library elements.

Installing
----------

You will need to build all sources into a static or dynamic library and link it in your program.
You will need to include "TTL.hpp", which includes all other sub-parts.
If you have code::blocks, then you can use the included project file in ide/codeblocks/project.cbp

Simplicity
----------

TTL is a very simple to use.
Check the documentation for samples.
