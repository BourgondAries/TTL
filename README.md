TTL - Tea Tank Library
======================

A C++ library of tools to make generic functionality easier to achieve.
The library's only dependence is the C++ standard library.
Many parts of the library are stand-alone parts and can function without other library elements.

Installing
----------

You will need to build all sources into a static or dynamic library and link it in your program.
You will need to include <TTL.hpp>, which includes all other sub-parts.
If you have code::blocks, then you can use the included project file in ide/codeblocks/project.cbp

Simplicity
----------

TTL is a very simple to use.
Check the documentation for samples.
